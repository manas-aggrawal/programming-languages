# CS5400 (Principles of Programming Languages)

This repo is for PL course I took under Prof. Eli Barzilay at Northeastern University, Boston during my MS Computer Science program.

It contains homeworks and small projects that I did during the course.

The most interesting one is HW12 - Toy Compiler. Where as the name suggests I along with my homework partner built a small compiler.
